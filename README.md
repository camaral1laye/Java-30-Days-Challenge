##My Journey Today 03/26/2024
    Today, I learned about Java packages, classes, and methods. I discovered how classes and methods interact with each other. First, I created a class called Main and added a main method along with another method called sayHey. In the sayHey method, I printed "Hi from SayHey in the main class". Then, I called the sayHey method from the main method within the Main class. To add more excitement, I created another class named Laye, which also had two methods: the main method and sayHi method. I then called the sayHi method from the main method within the Laye class. What's interesting is that to access the sayHi method from the Main class, I first had to call sayHi from its main method in the Laye class. The same trick also worked for sayHey. I found this interaction between classes and methods tricky yet fascinating. Happy coding!

##Really Live Scenario  
    Imagine you need to meet someone who lives in an apartment on the 10th floor of a building, but you only know their building address and apartment number. When you arrive at the building, there's a security guard at the front gate. You provide the security guard with the apartment number you're trying to reach. The security guard then calls the person in the 10th-floor apartment to ask for permission before allowing you to go up and meet them. Without the security guard calling ahead, you won't be able to access the person on the 10th floor.    Happy coding!!!!!!!!!

    Today lecture was based on access modifier. like public Private, and static acess modifier. I have learn very important topic how each acess modifier work. First, 
    Public  access: modifier specify how to access class, methods and fields.
        - The level of access is everywhere
            - Inside a class 
            - Outside a class
            - Inside the package 
            - Outside the package
    Private access modifier: the access level is only inside the class 

    Static non access modifier: you can access fields/methods using the name
        Ex: System.out
                    -> out is a static field of the system

Today's lecture was about variables. To understand variables, think of them like storage boxes where you keep your things organized. For example:
- **Box 1** is for books.
- **Box 2** is for pens.
- **Box 3** is for candy.

Each box has a label so you know what's inside. Now, when you ask me to get something from these boxes, I'll tell you where to find it. For instance:
- If you ask for a book, I'll say, "Check Box 1."
- If you ask for a pen, I'll say, "Check Box 2."
- If you ask for candy, I'll say, "Check Box 3."

Now, let's say you get a new box of candy, **Box 4**, and you have full of candy inside but you already have another candy box(**box3**) now you want the old candy inside the **Box3** to go faster but everyone remenber the old box which have old candy so to trick people you can just swiches the candy inside the old **box3** to the new **box4** and put the new candy inside the old **box3**.       Happy Code!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First, Today lecture is base on constant variable, let's say you are ask to give and output of string call name and you decide later to change the name or you type the name wrong, so to fixed the error you made you can just change name from the variable and it will automaticaly change from every output of the constant without any extra work
