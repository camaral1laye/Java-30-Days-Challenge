### Daily Challenges
- **Day 1 - Introduction to Java:** Watch the introductory video and follow along with the concepts explained.
- **Day 2 - Variables and Data Types:** Learn about variables and data types in Java and complete the exercises provided.  
- **Day 3 - Operators:** Explore various operators in Java and solve problems related to arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.
- **Day 4 - Control Flow:** Understand if statements, loops, and switch cases, and implement them in your code.
- **Day 5 - Arrays:** Dive into arrays in Java and work on exercises to manipulate array elements.
- **Day 6 - Methods:** Learn about methods/functions in Java and solve problems involving method declaration, invocation, and parameter passing.
- **Day 7 - Classes and Objects:** Understand classes and objects in Java and implement a simple class with methods and attributes.

Continue following the Neso Academy Java Playlist for the remaining days of the challenge. Each day, watch the tutorial video and complete the exercises and practice problems provided.

##My Journey Today 03/26/2024
    Today, I learned about Java packages, classes, and methods. I discovered how classes and methods interact with each other. First, I created a class called Main and added a main method along with another method called sayHey. In the sayHey method, I printed "Hi from SayHey in the main class". Then, I called the sayHey method from the main method within the Main class. To add more excitement, I created another class named Laye, which also had two methods: the main method and sayHi method. I then called the sayHi method from the main method within the Laye class. What's interesting is that to access the sayHi method from the Main class, I first had to call sayHi from its main method in the Laye class. The same trick also worked for sayHey. I found this interaction between classes and methods tricky yet fascinating. Happy coding!

##Really Live Scenario  
    Imagine you need to meet someone who lives in an apartment on the 10th floor of a building, but you only know their building address and apartment number. When you arrive at the building, there's a security guard at the front gate. You provide the security guard with the apartment number you're trying to reach. The security guard then calls the person in the 10th-floor apartment to ask for permission before allowing you to go up and meet them. Without the security guard calling ahead, you won't be able to access the person on the 10th floor.    Happy coding!!!!!!!!!
